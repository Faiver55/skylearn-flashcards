# SkyLearn Flashcards - LMS Integration Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of PHASE 3 LMS Integration for the SkyLearn Flashcards plugin. The implementation provides seamless integration with LearnDash and TutorLMS, enabling flashcard activities to be treated as first-class learning events within the LMS ecosystem.

## Implemented Components

### 1. LMS Manager (`includes/lms/class-lms-manager.php`)
The central coordinator for all LMS integrations, providing:

- **LMS Detection**: Automatically detects active LearnDash and TutorLMS installations
- **Settings Management**: Centralized configuration for all LMS integration features
- **Access Control**: Manages flashcard visibility based on course enrollment and completion
- **Progress Tracking**: Coordinates progress reporting across different LMS platforms
- **Admin Interface**: Provides metaboxes for linking flashcards to LMS content

**Key Methods:**
- `is_lms_integration_enabled()`: Check if LMS features are active
- `user_has_access()`: Verify user access to flashcard sets based on LMS enrollment
- `track_completion()`: Record flashcard completion in LMS systems
- `get_detected_lms()`: Return list of available LMS platforms

### 2. Enhanced LearnDash Integration (`includes/lms/class-learndash.php`)
Comprehensive integration with LearnDash LMS:

- **Lesson Integration**: Add flashcard tabs to lesson content
- **Progress Tracking**: Mark lessons complete when flashcards are finished with required accuracy
- **Grade Submission**: Submit flashcard scores to LearnDash reporting
- **Access Controls**: Restrict flashcard access based on course enrollment
- **Admin Metaboxes**: Link flashcards to specific lessons with accuracy requirements

**Key Features:**
- Automatic lesson completion when flashcard accuracy meets threshold
- Integration with LearnDash access control system
- Progress tracking in user meta data
- Support for required accuracy settings per lesson

### 3. Complete TutorLMS Integration (`includes/lms/class-tutorlms.php`)
Full-featured integration with TutorLMS:

- **Course and Lesson Integration**: Display flashcards in course and lesson contexts
- **Progress Tracking**: Record completion in TutorLMS dashboard
- **Grade Submission**: Submit scores to TutorLMS gradebook via quiz attempt records
- **Course Tabs**: Add flashcard tabs to course navigation
- **Admin Metaboxes**: Configure flashcard associations for courses and lessons

**Key Features:**
- Course-level flashcard display with enrollment checks
- Lesson-specific flashcard integration
- Automatic lesson completion based on flashcard performance
- Grade submission via TutorLMS quiz attempt system

### 4. LMS Settings Interface (`includes/admin/views/lms-settings.php`)
User-friendly admin interface for configuring LMS integration:

- **LMS Detection Display**: Shows detected LMS systems with version information
- **Integration Controls**: Enable/disable specific LMS features
- **Configuration Options**: Set accuracy requirements, enable auto-completion, etc.
- **Help Documentation**: Provides guidance on how to use LMS integration features

**Available Settings:**
- Enable/disable LMS integration
- Progress tracking in LMS
- Automatic lesson completion
- Grade submission to LMS gradebook
- Required accuracy percentage
- Enrollment-based access restrictions

### 5. Frontend Access Controls
Enhanced frontend rendering with LMS awareness:

- **Access Verification**: Check LMS enrollment before displaying flashcards
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic LMS progress updates on completion
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages for access restrictions
- **Action Hooks**: Integration points for other plugins

**Integration Points:**
- Shortcode renderer checks LMS access before displaying content
- Completion tracking automatically updates LMS progress
- Action hooks fire for additional integrations

### 6. Helper Functions (`includes/helpers.php`)
Utility functions for easy LMS integration:

- `skylearn_user_has_lms_access()`: Check user access to flashcard sets
- `skylearn_get_lms_status()`: Get current LMS integration status
- `skylearn_is_learndash_available()`: Check LearnDash availability
- `skylearn_is_tutorlms_available()`: Check TutorLMS availability
- `skylearn_track_lms_completion()`: Track completion in LMS
- `skylearn_get_lms_linked_sets()`: Get flashcards linked to LMS content

## Usage Examples

### For LearnDash Users:
1. Create flashcard sets in the admin
2. Edit LearnDash lessons and use the "SkyLearn Flashcards" metabox to link flashcard sets
3. Set required accuracy for lesson completion
4. Students see flashcards in lesson tabs and their progress is tracked

### For TutorLMS Users:
1. Create flashcard sets in the admin
2. Edit TutorLMS courses/lessons and link flashcard sets via metaboxes
3. Flashcards appear in course navigation tabs
4. Student progress is tracked in TutorLMS dashboard

### For Site Administrators:
1. Go to Flashcards → Settings → LMS Integration
2. Enable desired LMS features
3. Configure accuracy requirements and completion settings
4. Monitor progress through LMS reporting dashboards

## Technical Features

### Security
- Capability checks for all admin functions
- Nonce verification for form submissions
- Input sanitization and validation
- Permission-based access controls

### Performance
- Lazy loading of LMS integrations (only when LMS is active)
- Efficient database queries
- Minimal impact on non-LMS functionality
- Proper caching considerations

### Extensibility
- Modular architecture for adding new LMS platforms
- Action and filter hooks for customization
- Consistent API patterns across LMS integrations
- Well-documented code for developers

### Internationalization
- All strings properly wrapped with translation functions
- Text domain consistency throughout
- RTL-friendly admin interfaces
- Accessibility considerations in UI

## Configuration Options

### Global LMS Settings:
- **Enable LMS Integration**: Master switch for all LMS features
- **Progress Tracking**: Store progress in LMS user profiles
- **Auto Complete Lessons**: Mark lessons complete when flashcards are finished
- **Grade Submission**: Send scores to LMS gradebooks
- **Required Accuracy**: Default accuracy threshold (0-100%)
- **Enrollment Restrictions**: Limit access based on course enrollment

### Per-Flashcard Set Settings:
- **LMS Visibility**: Control who can see the flashcard set
  - All Users
  - Enrolled Users Only
