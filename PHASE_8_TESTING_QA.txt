SkyLearn Flashcards - Phase 8: Testing & QA
===========================================

Objectives:
-----------
- Ensure all plugin features work as intended, are secure, and deliver a seamless user experience.
- Validate compatibility with supported LMS platforms (LearnDash, TutorLMS) and major WordPress versions.
- Confirm accessibility, performance, and privacy compliance.

Technical Tasks:
----------------

1. Automated Testing
   - Implement unit tests for PHP logic using PHPUnit.
   - Write integration tests for flashcard creation, editing, display, and user performance tracking.
   - Add JavaScript tests (using Jest or similar) for frontend card interaction (flip, navigation, shuffle).

2. Manual Testing
   - Test all admin screens: set editor, settings, leads, reporting, export/import.
   - Test all frontend features: flashcard display, interaction, lead capture (premium), results summary, reporting.
   - Stress-test with large numbers of cards/sets and heavy user activity.
   - Test premium gating and upsell flows.

3. LMS Compatibility Testing
   - Install and activate LearnDash and TutorLMS in local/staging environments.
   - Test flashcard set mapping, progress tracking, grading, and reporting with both LMS plugins.
   - Verify fallback and error handling when LMS plugins are deactivated.

4. Accessibility Review
   - Use automated tools (axe, Lighthouse) and manual keyboard navigation to verify accessibility compliance.
   - Confirm ARIA roles, labels, and alt text for all interactive elements.

5. Cross-Device & Browser Testing
   - Test all screens on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

6. GDPR & Privacy Compliance
   - Review data collection, consent, and storage for lead capture and reporting.
   - Confirm privacy policy and terms links are displayed as required.
   - Test data deletion on uninstall.

7. Bug Tracking & Issue Management
   - Log all discovered bugs and UI/UX issues.
   - Create GitHub issues for all defects, assign and prioritize.
   - Track test results and regression cases.

8. Final Code Review & Optimization
   - Review code for security (sanitize/escape, nonce checks, capability checks).
   - Optimize database queries and frontend performance.
   - Confirm internationalization of all UI text.

Code Structure:
---------------
- `tests/phpunit/`                        # Unit/integration tests for PHP
- `tests/js/`                             # Frontend JS tests
- `assets/css/testing.css`                # Visual cues for test builds
- `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`                     # Manual and automated test procedures

AI Agent Instructions:
----------------------
- Scaffold all files/folders listed in Code Structure.
- Implement tests for all core, premium, and integration features.
- Run manual and automated tests as described.
- Log all bugs and create GitHub issues for triage.
- Document test procedures and results in `TEST_PLAN.md`.
- Ensure plugin meets accessibility and privacy standards before release.
